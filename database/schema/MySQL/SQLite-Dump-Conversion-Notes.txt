-----TABLES-----
SQLite Dump Files Create Errors in MySql. Change these in the dump file for import -->

1. Remove PRAGMA lines
2. Remove BEGIN TRANSACTION and END TRANSCATION
3. Remove COMMIT lines
4. Remove DELETE FROM and INSERT INTO the sqlite_sequence table (not sure what this is yet, insert seems to work OK after changing the other things)
5. Replace AUTOINCREMENT - with - AUTO_INCREMENT
6. Replace DEFAULT 't' and DEFAULT 'f' with DEFAULT '1' and DEFAULT '0' (Looks like boolean, check if this needs looked at)
7. Replace 't' and 'f' with '1' and '0'
8. Replace "" (quotes) with '' (single-quotes) except in string values (otherwise it replaces all quotes in text)
9. Remove CONSTRAINT names from dump file for CHECK constraints etc.
10. VARCHAR entries must have a specified size
11. "Int" is not a valid column name and will throw error: (PlayerGame/TeamGame tables + views)


*** Check column datatypes. Week needs to be changed to remove postseason string values. ***

-----VIEWS------
Change SQLite3 Views for MySql:

1. Create aliases for tables in the FROM clause
2. Select fields using the given aliases (rather than the table names)
3. Add () parentheses around the FROM clause elements
4. Use alias names in the LEFT JOIN ON statements (instead of table names)
